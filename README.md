# Connections Components - Documentation

This git repository contains details and descriptions on the Connections UI components and styles for customizing them.

It serves as a baseline for developers to understand how common areas within the UI/UX should be understood and designed. The primary purpose is to achieve consistency across the various applications and features that Connections provides.

The content within this repository works in tandem with the [HCL Design System](internal-link-redacted). Given the historic growth of the tool, not all areas can be redesigned via the design system. The Connections components align whereever possible but employ a different look and feel in some areas as well.

If something is not defined in this document, it either still needs to be (reach out to the [CNX 8 UI](internal-link-redacted) Teams channel / through Git for any findings), or by default aligns with the design system.
